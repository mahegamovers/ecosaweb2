# ECOSA Online

ECOSA Online is a React and TypeScript single-page app for the Equatorial College Old Students Association. It supports alumni registration, member discovery, membership payments, community posts, jobs, leadership information, chapters, resources, and project donation flows.

## System Architecture

The project is a client-rendered Vite application. Netlify serves the built static assets from `dist`, and `public/_redirects` rewrites all routes to `index.html` so React Router can handle deep links.

Current runtime layers:

- **Static hosting:** Vite builds the SPA from `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, and the route components under `src/pages`.
- **Routing:** `react-router-dom` defines browser routes in `src/App.tsx`.
- **UI shell:** `src/components/Header.tsx` renders the global navigation and ECOSA logo assets from `public`.
- **Data service:** `src/services/mockService.ts` centralizes all member, payment, post, poll, leader, job, and resource operations.
- **Persistence:** The app currently stores demo data in browser `localStorage`. The service layer also attempts requests to `http://localhost:4000/api` for compatible local API endpoints and falls back to local storage if the API is unavailable.
- **Assets:** Static logos and sample media live in `public` and are referenced with root-relative URLs or `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.

There are no Netlify Functions, database schema, or production backend modules in this repository at the moment.

## User Workflow

1. Visitors land on the home page and can register, pay membership fees, browse community updates, search members, or review ECOSA projects.
2. Registration creates or updates a member record through `registerMember` in the shared service layer.
3. Payments collect member details, create a member when needed, and record a local payment entry. If a local API is running, payment initiation is attempted before falling back to local recording.
4. Community, jobs, leaders, resources, and member pages read from the same service layer so the app can work as a self-contained demo.
5. The dashboard route exists for admin review and publishing community updates, but it is not linked from the public navigation.

```

Important implementation notes:

- `mockService.ts` is the boundary between UI code and persistence. New pages should use this service instead of reading or writing `localStorage` directly.
- Seed data is initialized in the browser when the service module loads.
- Payment buttons currently simulate successful local recording when no local API responds.
- `scripts/ensure-build-deps.cjs` installs dependencies during the build script if `node_modules/.bin/vite` is missing.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the Vite dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build command used by the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview a built app locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

Netlify can deploy this project as a static Vite site.

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- SPA fallback: configured in `public/_redirects`

If production persistence is added later, replace the local API fallback with Netlify Functions and Netlify Database so registration, payments, posts, votes, resources, and jobs survive across browsers and devices.
